## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **pragmatic architect** with **6+ years of experience** building enterprise-grade systems and lean, automated web solutions. I specialize in bridging complex enterprise requirements with high-velocity SaaS development.

Currently bootstrapping **ByteForge** — pivoting from a software house to a product-led SaaS company focused on niche, high-efficiency tools.

**Core Philosophy:** High-output, resilient, zero-fluff. I build systems that scale and businesses that last.
